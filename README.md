# twitter_manager_py

Simple example demonstrating X's 3-legged OAuth authentication with Flask

## Configuration Steps
- Create new project and app via X Developer Portal.
- Get your *CONSUMER_API_KEY* and *CONSUMER_API_SECRET* - those are refferring to the **developer's** account.
- Turn on OAuth 1.0 under the User authentication settings section of your appâ€™s Settings tab. **NB**: Active DNS-record and local ngrok tunnel are required.
- After enabling OAuth 1.0, get your *CLIENT_ID* and *CLIENT_SECRET* - those are also refferring to the **developer's** account.
- Specify callback url (based on the ngrok tunnel url in app.py).

## Authentication Process
- When user visits home page, **TwitterAuthHandler** will provide an active authentication url to X UI.
- User visits the url and authorizes the app to read data from his X Account.
- User is redirected to the app's callback url. At this moment the app receives in request params *oauth_token* and *oauth_verifier*. Based on these, **TwitterAuthHandler** will collect the **user's** *access_token* and *access_secret*, which can be stored for further requests to X API (in the example they are stored in Flask's session).
- Based on the **user's** *access_token* and *access_secret*, **TwitterApiProvider** is able to retrieve data via X API.
